        <p class="quote">Epoxy, snaps, dings, fins,  plugs, fibreglass, paddles, boats ... just whatever</p>

        <p>South Coast Surf Repairs is another fine example of back-yard Kiwi business getting the job done. After over 20 years of repairing and shaping surf boards means you've seen it all!</p>
            
            <p>Using quality materials I offer a fast and friendly service. I am flexible on drop off and pick up times. I repair a wide range of water craft; surfboards and club boards to everything in between. I can replace FCS plugs, glass on fins, snaps, creases, large and small dings and any other damage your board has sustained. I can repair polyester and epoxy boards. With Epoxy now becoming so popular I keep up to date with the latest and greatest. Epoxy resins are getting so much better and they are not the nightmare to repair that they once were. Half of the board I repair are epoxy and I have a huge amount of experience getting them back up to scratch.</p>
            
            <p>I am happy to consider any fibre glass work. I have repaired windsurfers, SUP paddles, Boats, car parks, you name it. If it is made of fibreglass chances are I can repair it.</p>
            
            <p>I am interested in your input as to how you would like to see your board repaired. For example a snap, do you want the stringer replaced or would you rather an extra layer of glass. We can talk about it so you get what you want! I am also using sun bake UV curing resin which considerably speeds up the curing process while creating a stronger repair. This means your board will be finished much faster. With UV curing resin urgent repairs can be finished in 24 hours. My aim is to get you and your board back in the water quickly for an affordable price. I will beat any genuine quote.</p>
